  <p style="position: absolute; color: bisque; top: 130%; left: 1%; font-size: xx-large">Born in the fall of 2001 in Bellevue, I have been living in the Greater Seattle Area ever since. From a young age,
  I have been exposed to 'tech' companies such as the likes of Microsoft and Amazon, from where my intial spark of interest for software was
  ignited. After taking my first coding class in high school, my curiosity for software development only grew deeper. I hope to take my interest in this field to contribute
  towards the benefit of society.</p>

  involved in any events happening within the Muslim community.</p>
